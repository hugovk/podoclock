Pod O'Clock change log
======================
2.06 (15th August 2011)
* Check for podcasts on all drives.
* Optimisation: check MIME type only for randomly selected file, not for all when building mp3 list.
* Versions: Use a different, rounded icon for Ovi-signed, created using the Harmattan Icon Generator http://depot.javispedro.com/nit/hicg/ and put through SVG Converter.
* Versions: Ovi-signed is version 3.x, self-signed is version 2.x.
* Upgrading: When launching self-signed, will attempt to launch Ovi-signed.
* Upgrading: When hiding Ovi-signed, will attempt to uninstall self-signed.

2.05 (3rd July 2011)
* Ran the icons through Nokia's SVG Converter.
* Use the default web browser (for example Opera Mobile or Nokia browser). Only supported when Ovi-signed with SwEvent. This is self-signed.

2.04 (19th June 2011)
Add macro in .mmh to build with either self-signed UIDs or with Ovi-signed UIDs.

2.03 (19th June 2011)
When scanning .mp3 files, only add those with audio/mpeg MIME type to the shortlist. This avoids those mis-downloaded .mp3 files that contain text or html (usually with a 404/file not found error). 

2.02 (19th January 2011)
* You can press the last played filename to play it again (Sam)
* Display ?/[total] after deleting a file

2.00 (13th December 2010)
Now embeds the phone's own music player instead of implementing it all from scratch. Numerous benefits:
 * scrobbles with Mobbler
 * much better music player UI 
 * album art
 * rewind, fast forward, scan
 * native volume handling
 * interruption from calls, phone alarms
 * fewer bugs
 * smaller binary
Added touch feedback for Symbian^1 and Symbian^3, thanks to Mobbler for the open source code: http://code.google.com/p/mobbler/ and Tango Desktop Project for the icons.
Added a "More apps" menu option to promote Data Quota and Mobbler.

1.20 (15th November 2010)

Changed the file finding to find all *.mp3s under E:\podcasts\ instead of just those under E:\podcasts\sounds\, so it works with Symbian Podcatcher
Load more strings from the loc file
